            <b>March 23-24, 2025</b>: We convened the first Safety-Net Hospital AI Symposium, which was generously hosted by the San Francisco General Hospital Foundation and funded by America's Essential Hospitals.
                We had five safety-net hospitals come together, each representing different regions across the U.S., to discuss each institution's AI strategy and how a collaboration between our groups could ensure AI also serves vulnerable patient populations and low-resource hospitals.
                Participating members of the symposium were ZSFG (CA), Parkland (TX), Grady (GA), Spartanburg (SC), and Eskenazi (IN).
