Patient has been experiencing homelessness since May 2023. Previously worked as a warehouse supervisor but lost job due to substance use. Reports using methamphetamine for approximately 2 years, initially to stay awake for work, now dependent. Has tried to quit multiple times without success. No family support - estranged from siblings, parents deceased. Patient is interested in substance use treatment but worried about where he would stay during recovery. Currently receives CalFresh benefits but reports they are insufficient. Discussed shelter options and SUD treatment programs. Patient expressed interest in residential treatment if housing could be arranged. Will coordinate with ECM team."},{"id":"note-a3","date":"2024-01-17","type":"Care Coordination Note","provider":"Janet Williams, RN Care Manager","content":"Patient has had 6 ED visits in the past 6 months, primarily for complications related to diabetes and wounds. Pattern suggests difficulty managing chronic conditions while homeless. Patient reports he cannot afford his diabetes medications consistently and often rations insulin. Food insecurity contributing to poor glycemic control - patient admits to eating whatever is available, often high in carbohydrates. Transportation is also a barrier - patient walks or takes bus to appointments when he has fare money. Recommend referral to ECM program given homelessness, high ED utilization, and SUD. Also recommend referral to Food is Medicine program given diabetes and food insecurity."}],"risks":[{"domain":"housing","severity":"high","summary":"Currently experiencing homelessness for 8+ months, living on streets","citations":[{"text":"Patient reports he has been living on the streets for the past 8 months after losing his apartment","noteDate":"2024-01-15","noteType":"ED Visit"},{"text":"Patient has been experiencing homelessness since May 2023","noteDate":"2024-01-16","noteType":"Social Work Note"}],"recommendations":["Refer to ECM program for intensive care coordination","Connect with Housing for Health program","Explore recuperative care/medical respite options","Coordinate with homeless outreach team"]},{"domain":"substance_use","severity":"high","summary":"Active methamphetamine use disorder, using for 2 years, interested in treatment","citations":[{"text":"States he has been using methamphetamine intermittently, last use 3 days ago","noteDate":"2024-01-15","noteType":"ED Visit"},{"text":"Reports using methamphetamine for approximately 2 years, initially to stay awake for work, now dependent","noteDate":"2024-01-16","noteType":"Social Work Note"}],"recommendations":["Refer to residential SUD treatment program","Consider MAT evaluation","Connect with peer support specialist","Coordinate housing with treatment (recovery bridge housing)"]},{"domain":"food_insecurity","severity":"high","summary":"Food insecurity affecting diabetes management, relies on food banks, misses meals","citations":[{"text":"Patient states he sometimes goes to food banks but often misses meals","noteDate":"2024-01-15","noteType":"ED Visit"},{"text":"Currently receives CalFresh benefits but reports they are insufficient","noteDate":"2024-01-16","noteType":"Social Work Note"},{"text":"Food insecurity contributing to poor glycemic control - patient admits to eating whatever is available","noteDate":"2024-01-17","noteType":"Care Coordination Note"}],"recommendations":["Refer to Food Pharmacy / Medically Tailored Meals program","Maximize CalFresh benefits","Connect with diabetes-friendly meal programs","Provide list of food banks in patient's area"]},{"domain":"financial_strain","severity":"high","summary":"Cannot afford medications, unemployed, limited income","citations":[{"text":"Patient reports he cannot afford his diabetes medications consistently and often rations insulin","noteDate":"2024-01-17","noteType":"Care Coordination Note"},{"text":"Previously worked as a warehouse supervisor but lost job due to substance use","noteDate":"2024-01-16","noteType":"Social Work Note"}],"recommendations":["Connect with pharmacy assistance programs","Ensure Medi-Cal coverage is active","Explore SSI/SSDI eligibility","Connect with employment services after stabilization"]},{"domain":"social_isolation","severity":"moderate","summary":"Estranged from family, limited social support","citations":[{"text":"No family support - estranged from siblings, parents deceased","noteDate":"2024-01-16","noteType":"Social Work Note"}],"recommendations":["Connect with peer support services","Explore community support groups","Consider case management for ongoing support"]},{"domain":"transportation","severity":"moderate","summary":"Relies on walking or bus, often lacks fare money","citations":[{"text":"Transportation is also a barrier - patient walks or takes bus to appointments when he has fare money","noteDate":"2024-01-17","noteType":"Care Coordination Note"}],"recommendations":["Arrange Medi-Cal Non-Emergency Medical Transportation (NEMT)","Provide bus tokens for appointments","Schedule appointments near patient's location when possible"]}],"eligibility":[],"ecmPopulations":["homeless","serious_mental_health_sud","high_ed_utilization"]}}],["$L3","$L4"],"$L5"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
