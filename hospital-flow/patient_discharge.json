Daughter: Taylor Rivera – Mobile: (555) 017-9360. Both children work full-time and live approximately 30 minutes away.\n\nFunctional Status:\nPrior to admission, patient was independent with all ADLs and IADLs. Post-stroke, patient demonstrates mild left-sided weakness and requires minimal assistance with transfers and bathing. PT/OT evaluating.\n\nDischarge Planning:\nPatient lives alone in an upstairs apartment and will require assistance with ADLs following discharge.

Anticipate 2–3 week approval lag, so temporary family support will be needed at discharge.

Transportation referral submitted today to ensure continuity of care; delay in securing reliable transport may impact ability to attend post-stroke follow-up within recommended timeframe.\n\nFamily Meeting:\nMet with both children at bedside.
